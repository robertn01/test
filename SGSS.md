# NHS (England) Digital - Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS)

COVID-19 Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) - Demographic and diagnostic information concerning antigen test reports for COVID-19, in England only. This dataset currently includes the first positive results from Pillar 1 (swab testing in PHE and NHS hospital labs), and Pillar 2 (swab testing for the wider population). Future flows are anticipated to include all positive, negative, void and inconclusive test results. This would mean the asset would no longer be limited to just be the first positive results. The NHS Digital SGSS asset is NHS Digitalâ€™s only source for Pillar 1 testing data. Pillar 2 testing data is also available to request as a separate product.

SGSS is an application that stores and manages data on laboratory isolates and notifications, and is the preferred method for capturing routine laboratory surveillance data on infectious diseases and antimicrobial resistance from diagnostic laboratories across England. The data is stored in a central database within PHE, and made available to a wide range of users within and outwith the organisation, subject to robust access control mechanisms.
