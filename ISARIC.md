The ISARIC study collects a wide range of information from patients either hospitalised from or with COVID-19 during the pandemic.

For a more detailed look at how the data is cleaned, all R cleaning scripts are located in the following public repository:

The above repository also contains information on the structural metadata, for example, explanations of the various forms and events that compose the data are found here. Users of this wiki are encouraged to read through this additional repository to gain further insight into the data.
