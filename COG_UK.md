Spike protein structures showing locations of amino acid residues that are mutated in each variant of concern (VOC). The spike protein protrudes from the surface of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, is responsible for initating binding to and entry into host cells, and is also the primary target for antibodies that recognise the virus.

Consult our own Metadata Catalogue for the
* [[COG UK metadata|COGUK_metadata]] metadata (e.g. `cog_metadata.csv`), corresponds to `alignment` patients
* [[COG UK naive variants|COGUK_naive_variants]] naive variants (e.g. `naive_variants.csv`)
* Consensus sequence (e.g. `cog_all.fasta`) in FASTA format
* Full alignment (e.g. `cog_alignment.fasta`) in FASTA format
* Unmasked alignment (e.g. `cog_unmasked_alignment.fasta`) in FASTA format, same set of patients as `cog_all`

A note about identifiers:
* the main component of the patient identifier is the ISARIC id (in the form `ABCD-0123`)
* the ISARIC id will be given a numerical suffix (`.1`, `.2`, `.3` etc) because there may be multiple samples per patient
* the FASTA identifier has that ISARIC id surrounded by /England/ and /year/ (e.g. `/England/ABCD-0123.1/2020`)
* some patients have multiple ISARIC ids

A note about multiple samples per patient: each physical sample should be assigned exactly one COG ID and any re-sequencing of the same sample should be submitted under the same COG ID. In practise, this is not enforced (and hard to do so anyway) and submitting organisations (including PHE/UKHSA) have often issued new COG IDs for the same sample, resulting in multiple COG IDs actually referring to the same swab. Trying to de-duplicate on sample date is not entirely reliable (frequently off by a day or two in different reports) and it would also be perfectly legitimate to have more than one actually distinct samples (like a throat and a nose swab) on the same day from the same patient.

A note about the FASTA format: some of the letters are lower-case because they are masked.
