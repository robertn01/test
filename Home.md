Welcome to the ODAP Datasets Wiki.

This wiki is intended to describe the variables available in datasets held in the Outbreak Data Analysis Platform.
In general, the data dictionaries provided by the original data supplier should be considered authoritative, but
there are often changes made during deliver which result in a different set of variables being made available,
or the variable names will have been altered, or sometimes even the content of a variable may have changed, for
example to reduce the risk of patient re-identification.

Where possible, datasets will have list of all variables which can be supplied, a note of their data type
(e.g. number or date), a description, a list of available values, and other metadata. In some cases only the
data type will be available.
