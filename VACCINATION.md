# NHS (England) Digital - Vaccination Data Sets

 Provide information to us at NHS Digital relating to coronavirus (COVID-19) and seasonal flu 2021-22 vaccinations.

The NHS is delivering the coronavirus (COVID-19) vaccination programme. This includes making sure the right data and technology solutions are in place for vaccinations to be delivered safely and efficiently. The NHS is delivering the vaccine in 3 main ways:  

   *  hospital hubs - NHS providers vaccinating on site 
   *  local vaccine services – community or primary care led services which could include primary care facilities, community pharmacies  and walk-in vaccination sites 
   *  vaccination centres – large sites set up for high volumes of people 


**The national programme**

The national NHS COVID-19 vaccination programme is led by NHS England and NHS Improvement. It involves departments across government, Public Health England, DHSC, NHS Digital and other organisations across the health and care system.

The independent Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) uses the best available clinical, modelling and epidemiological data to advise the government on:

  *  which vaccine or vaccines the UK should use
  *  the groups that should be prioritised to receive the vaccine 

The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) manages the licensing and approval of vaccines.

Consult our own Metadata Catalogue for either of the following tables:

  *  [[Vaccination status table 1|VaccStatus_table_1]]
  *  [[Vaccination status table 2|VaccStatus_table_2]]
  *  [[Vaccination adverse reactions table 2|VaccAR_table_2]]
