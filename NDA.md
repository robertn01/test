# NHS (England) Digital - National Diabetes Audit (NDA)

The National Diabetes Audit (NDA) Programme was originally developed to help improve services and monitor the impact of the diabetes national service framework (NSF). Since 2011 the child (paediatric) component has been delivered by the [Royal College of Paediatric Child Health (RCPCH)](https://www.rcpch.ac.uk/work-we-do/quality-improvement-patient-safety/national-paediatric-diabetes-audit).

The NDA Core Audit data table is including NDA core, Type 1, Adolescent and Young Adult (AYA), Young Type 2 and Diabetes Prevention Programme.

**Aims and objectives of the NDA**

The NDA helps improve the quality of diabetes care by enabling participating NHS services and organisations to:

*  assess local practice against National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines
*  compare their care and outcomes with similar services and organisations
*  identify gaps or shortfalls that are priorities for improvement
*  identify and share best practice
*  provide comprehensive national pictures of diabetes care and outcomes in England and Wales

Through participation in the audit, local services are able to benchmark their performance, identify where they are performing well, and improve the quality of treatment and care they provide.

A Quality Improvement Toolkit has been developed in collaboration with the Royal College of General Practitioners (RCGP) to help practices use their diabetes data to improve services.

Diabetes UK manages Quality Improvement Collaboratives (QIC) which set local aims to improve diabetes care. Using audit data, specialist services work together with other providers to develop skills, share learning and improve clinical practice.
