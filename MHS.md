# NHS (England) Digital - Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS)


The Mental Health Services Data Set (MHSDS) brings together information captured on clinical systems as part of patient care. It covers not only services provided in hospitals but also outpatient clinics and in the community, where the majority of people in contact with these services are treated. It is a patient level, output based, secondary uses data set which aims to deliver robust, comprehensive, nationally consistent and comparable person-based information for children, young people and adults who are in contact with services for mental health and wellbeing, learning disability, autism or other neurodevelopmental conditions.  As a secondary uses data set it re-uses clinical and operational data for purposes other than direct patient care. It defines the data items, definitions and associated value sets to be extracted or derived from local information systems.

The MHSDS 

This information standard is published under section 250 of the Health and Social Care Act 2012. An Information Standards Notice (see below) provides an overview of scope and implementation timescales, and the other listed documents provide further detail for those who have to implement the information standard.
