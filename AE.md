# Hospital Accident & Emergency (AE) Activity data set

Data cover Accident and Emergency (A&E) activity in English NHS hospitals and English NHS-commissioned activity in the independent sector.

The data set consist of the Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS) for 2020-21, HES A&E for activity prior to 2020-21 and the A&E Attendances and Emergency Admissions Monthly Situation Reports (MSitAE). This is the first year this report has been produced using ECDS in its submitted format, replacing the use of Hospital Episode Statistics (HES).
