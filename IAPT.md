# Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) data set
**Collecting information about people in contact with adult psychological therapy services in England.**

*Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT)* is an NHS programme began in 2008 in England that offers interventions approved by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) for transforming the treatment of people with depression or anxiety disorders. 

The IAPT programme is supported by a regular return of data generated by providers of IAPT services in delivering those services to patients. These data are received by NHS Digital and released as statistical publications covering activity, waiting times and patient outcomes such as recovery.
