# NHS (England) Digital - Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS)

The Second Generation Surveillance System (SGSS) is an application that stores and
manages data on laboratory isolates and notifications, and is the preferred method for
capturing routine laboratory surveillance data on infectious diseases and antimicrobial
resistance from diagnostic laboratories across England. The data is stored in a central
database within PHE, and made available to a wide range of users within and outwith
the organisation, subject to robust access control mechanisms.

Consult our own Metadata Catalogue for the [[SGSS|SGSS_main_table]] main table.
