# NHS (England) Digital - National Immunisation Management System

This service works via a ** National Immunisation Management System (NIMS) ** web app is provided by the NHS South, Central and West Commissioning Support Unit (SCW CSU) and is used on desktop and mobile devices to record vaccination details and adverse reactions for both NHS and social care staff and patients.

The vaccination and event data feeds into the National Immunisation Service in real-time and will also be sent to GP systems. The app also provides a view of previous immunisations held in the database.

A near real-time dashboard is available for monitoring.
