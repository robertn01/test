# NHS (England) Digital - Emergency Care Data Set

The Emergency Care Data Set (ECDS) is the national data set for urgent and emergency care. It replaced Accident and Emergency Commissioning Data Set (CDS type 010) and was implemented through: ECDS (CDS 6.2.2 Type 011 and subsequent releases).

ECDS allows NHS Digital to provide information to support the care provided in emergency departments by including the data items needed to understand capacity and demand and help improve patient care.

The ECDS collects information about why people attend emergency departments and the treatment they receive to:

  *  Improve patient care through better and more consistent information
  *  Allow better planning of healthcare services
  *  Improve communication between health professionals

Consult our own Metadata Catalogue for the [ECDS](https://github.com/isaric4c/wiki/wiki/ECDS_main_table) table.
